# Verifying Programs with Stainless ASPLOS 2022

## About the tutorial
[Stainless](https://stainless.epfl.ch/) is a system for constructing formally-verified software
that is guaranteed to meet specifications for all inputs.
The primary input format to Stainless is a subset of [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
In addition, programs designed to run with pre-allocated memory (e.g., on an embedded system)
can be translated to C and processed using conventional C compilers.

This tutorial will provide a hands-on introduction to Stainless through a
series of guided examples. We will assume only basic programming skills; no
particular background in verification or Scala is required, though a basic
understanding of functional programming concepts will be helpful.

## Location and date
**Location:** [Swiss Tech Convention Center](https://www.stcc.ch/) near the campus of EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.

**Time:** Tuesday, March 1st, afternoon
